# Arrow
Find the index of the first arrow using which all the arrows can be visited once.

This program traverses a 5x5 field in which specific arrows are mentioned. Each arrow changes the direction of the traversal. The aim of the code is to find the index of the first arrow using which all the arrows will be visited once.

Jumping across an arrow is not allowed and each arrow can be visited once.

It is safe to assume that the grid has no loops using the arrows.
